Welcome to the **Terminal Journal Viewer**—a feature-rich journal navigation and viewing application built entirely in Golang, leveraging the [Bubble Tea framework](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) for a smooth and responsive terminal UI. 🎉

This application is built to enhance user experience of those using the [jrnl CLI tool](https://jrnl.sh/). If you use `jrnl` to maintain your journal, this app is the **perfect companion** to enhance your workflow as it directly pulls your entries from the selected journal created by `jrnl`.

  View your journal entries, each one distinctly separated for clarity. This mode includes:

  - Smooth transitions between entries.

## 🚀 Why Use This Application?

This project is ideal for users who prefer the command line and want a visually appealing yet straightforward way to access and read their journal entries. With this application, managing your journals becomes a joy rather than a chore. ✍️
